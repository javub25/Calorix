## What are MET values?  

It's a way of measuring how much energy your body uses during different activities.

Each sport has three intensity levels with corresponding MET values:  

- **low**: Light effort  
- **medium**: Moderate effort  
- **high**: Intense effort  

### MET Values by Sport  

| 🏅 Sport          | ⚡ Low | 🔥 Medium | 🚀 High  |
|--------------------|-------|---------|--------|
| **🏃 Athletics**    | 6.0   | 8.0     | 12.0   |
| **🎾 Padel**        | 4.0   | 6.0     | 9.0    |
| **🏸 Tennis**       | 5.0   | 7.0     | 10.0   |
| **🏊 Swimming**     | 6.0   | 9.0     | 12.0   |
| **🚴 Cycling**      | 4.5   | 8.0     | 12.0   |
| **⚽ Football**     | 6.5   | 9.0     | 12.5   |
| **🥊 Boxing**       | 5.0   | 8.0     | 12.0   |

<summary>🤔 How could I store Select shadcn/ui components values?</summary>

Controller

· It allows me to store controlled component Select (sport, intensity)
values through own state and onChange event.
<br/>
By default, <b>controlled components</b> work with change states coming from external Shadcn UI library such as Select component.
<br/>
Therefore, functions such as useForm register, cannot work with those external components and components focus on <b>uncontrolled components</b> references instead.

<summary> 🤔 How could we calculate weight loss? </summary>

To estimated weight loss, we use the next relationship: 

```javascript
body fat 1kg = 7700 kcal
```

Once we know that 1kg of body fat equals **7,700 kcal**, we can estimate weight loss using the following formula:

```javascript
Weight loss (kg) = Calories / 7700 kcal
```
Whether you wanna the result in grams, multiply it by **1000**.
